# Automated-Attendance-via-Computer-Vision
This ongoing project aims to design a computer vision–based system that can automatically detect and record student attendance in classrooms and labs. Instead of relying on manual roll calls or paper-based tracking, the system will use facial recognition or person-detection models to recognize individuals in real time and log their presence securely.

The project is currently in its early development phase, focusing on dataset preparation, model experimentation, and evaluating different approach pipelines. 

The project prioritizes experimentation, exploration, and transparent reporting. All members are expected to maintain periodic individual reports, contributing to the final project summary.

## Live Deployment Link: *will be available after the end of the project*

## 🗓️ Project Roadmap

### **📅 11 November 2025 – 17 November 2025**  
**Phase: Problem Understanding & Approach Brainstorming**  
- Define the problem clearly.  
- Brainstorm possible AI approaches:  
  - Using large personalized datasets (memorization style)  
  - Using minimal data but emphasizing generalization  
  - CNN-based classification  
  - Vision Transformer–based classification
  - or others methods
- Begin and maintain your **individual report**.

---

### **📅 17 November 2025 – 24 November 2025**  
**Phase: Data Collection / Volunteer Recruitment**  
- Identify volunteers willing to share facial data to support model development.  
- If volunteer data is insufficient:  
  - Consider generating synthetic facial data (e.g., through Gemini Nanobanana).  
  - OR use publicly available images of well-known public figures.  
- Continue updating your **individual report**.

---

### **📅 24 November 2025 – 10 December 2025**  
**Phase: Modeling & Experimentation**  
- Work on your chosen approach.  
- Tasks may include:  
  - Model development  
  - Evaluation  
  - Building the inferencing pipeline  
- Each member may work with different approaches or different models within the same approach.  
- Keep updating the **individual report**.

---

### **📅 10 December 2025 – 25 December 2025**  
**Phase: Deployment Exploration**  
- Explore ways to deploy your model publicly.  
- Could be:  
  - Streamlit  
  - Gradio  
  - Flask/FastAPI  
  - Basic demo interface  
- Continue adding updates to your **individual report**.

---

### **📅 25 December 2025 – 10 January 2026**  
**Phase: Final Summary & Report Writing**  
- Summarize all individual reports and findings.  
- Prepare the **final project report** (brief, not a research paper).  
- A sample template will be shared.

---

## 📂 GitHub File Requirements

### **1. Periodical Individual Reports (PDF)**  
Each member must upload **one PDF** containing all their periodical updates.  
Updates should be added at the end of each phase.

### **2. Dataset Information (PDF)**  
Must include:  
- Public dataset link  
- Description of dataset  
- Sample size  
- Feature details  
- Any preprocessing steps

### **3. Additional Code Files**  
Include all relevant scripts, notebooks, or utilities used during experimentation or model development.  
This ensures reproducibility and transparency.

## Summary
This project is structured to encourage independent experimentation alongside collaborative reporting. Members follow a clearly defined timeline, produce their own modeling attempts, and finally merge insights into a unified project outcome.
