# Automated-Attendance-via-Computer-Vision
This ongoing project aims to design a computer vision–based system that can automatically detect and record student attendance in classrooms and labs. Instead of relying on manual roll calls or paper-based tracking, the system will use facial recognition or person-detection models to recognize individuals in real time and log their presence securely.

The project is currently in its early development phase, focusing on dataset preparation, model experimentation, and evaluating different approach pipelines.
